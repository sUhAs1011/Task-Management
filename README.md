# Task-Management

This is our third Mini project in Web Technologies, encompassing a rudimentary task-management 
system with both front-end (App.js) and back-end (index.js) components.

Command for running the front-end
```shell
npm start
```
Command for running the back-end
```shell
node index.js
```
