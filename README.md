# Task-Management

This is my third Web Technologies Mini project, where we have a made a basic task-management project, which consists of both the front-end and the back-end

The App.js is the front end part and the index.js is the backend part

Command for running the front-end
```shell
npm start
```
Command for running the back-end
```shell
node index.js
```
